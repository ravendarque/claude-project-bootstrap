# Working with Claude

How Claude is run on this project, to get good results without spending
tokens on work that doesn't need the most capable model.

## Model routing

One Sonnet-class subagent does all delegated work, one at a time.

- **The main session runs an Opus-class model.** It owns design, scoping
  issues, architecture decisions, review judgement, anything security- or
  privacy-sensitive, approvals, and the final verification before anything
  is called done.
- **All delegated work goes to at most one Sonnet-class subagent at a time**
  (`model: sonnet`): dependency bumps, running test suites and reporting
  their output, board and label housekeeping, executing an agreed plan step
  by step, bulk renames, doc updates from a settled decision, digging
  through CI logs, and longer investigations.
- **No sub-sessions, no mix of sessions and subagents, and no parallel
  workers**, even when their files don't overlap. Extra or parallel agents
  use up subscription token limits too quickly. Sub-sessions were tried
  first because they show in the sidebar, but they couldn't be governed.
- **Long or open-ended work is split into sequential subagent runs.** The
  main session decides between them.
- **Follow-ups go to the existing subagent**, not a new one.
- **A subagent gets its own worktree whenever it writes code**, and it and
  the main session never write the same files.
- **Briefs are self-contained**: the files involved, what done looks like,
  and the instruction to run slow commands (test suites, e2e) in the
  foreground, never in the background.
- **The main session checks the subagent's results** (the diff, the real
  test output) before reporting them as done.

The bootstrap skill is the scripted case. Its `bootstrap-executor` agent
(`agents/bootstrap-executor.md`) does scaffolding and its smoke check,
GitHub configuration and the first-PR mechanics, while the main session
keeps the interview, the plan, each go-ahead, repository creation and the
initial push, and the verification. The plugin's routing mod
(`hooks/register.js`) forces the executor onto Sonnet and refuses any second
subagent, of any type, while one is active:
[ADR-0003](adr/0003-enforce-model-routing-with-executor-agent-and-mod.md),
[ADR-0004](adr/0004-limit-every-subagent-spawn-to-one-at-a-time.md).

## Memory

- One fact per file, with frontmatter: name, one-line description, type
  (user, feedback, project, reference).
- `MEMORY.md` is the index: one line per memory, nothing else.
- Update an existing memory rather than adding a duplicate; delete one that
  turns out to be wrong.
- Don't save what the repo already records (code, docs, git history).

## Keeping context small

- `CLAUDE.md` is an index of one-line rules linking here and to the other
  docs. Add a rule as a line and its detail to a doc, never a paragraph to
  `CLAUDE.md`.
- Docs are short and split by topic. A doc that grows past a few screens
  gets split.
- Redirect long command output to a file and read its tail.

## Operational lessons

- There's no such thing as a flaky test, only a bad test or a real bug.
  Capture the full output and find the cause.
- Wait on PR checks with `gh pr checks --watch --fail-fast` and act on the
  first failure at once.
- Run the type checker locally before pushing; CI runs it as its own job.
- Run the e2e suite once per verification pass, not twice by default.
- Before blaming a file watcher for stale output, check for a duplicate dev
  server (`ps aux`).
- Never `pgrep -f` inside a `bash -c` wait loop: it matches itself.
- Test setup never reaches real external services. Local secrets files hold
  real keys.
- Check what the platform already provides before building ops tooling, and
  prefer the platform's newest feature unless there's a stated reason not to.
- Treat Claude-written docs as unverified until a person confirms them,
  especially anything phrased as "by design".
- When a needed tool or library is missing, say so and discuss options
  before improvising a workaround.
- Check an item's full stated scope before calling it done.
